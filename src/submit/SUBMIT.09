CS 106 Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Alex and Jasper

What work are you proud of?

  - Really running most of the 105 homework, fewer bugs in SVM, writing CPS,
    some better error messages than the vscheme interpreter (especially for
    undefined functions)

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - sugaring let expressions

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - sugaring let expressions, reading a bunch of lets is not fun

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - No

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - One noticable change for this submission is the predefined functions
    generated by vscheme, we removed the comment after code in line 92


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - Yes

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - I would learn the most from debugging experience with examples,
    but more understanding on the mechanism of K Normalizing is super
    helpful (though the code more or less follows the guides in module 9)

Again supposing you are not selected to present, are you willing to
serve on the review panel? (Or if there are more than one of you, who
is willing to serve?)

  - Alex and Jasper
