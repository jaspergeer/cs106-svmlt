CS 106 Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Alexander Bai, Jaspeer Geer

What work are you proud of?

  - literal pool (make L injective, saves memory), and keeping
    makeLiteral and getLiteral constant time

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - the data structure of globals, getting a global slot is linear time.
    the semantics of SetGlobal and GetGlobal

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - Don't look at our code 

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - We used Norman's code for globals, Cons instructions, in vmrun.c
    vmstate.h, vmstate.c

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - all kinds of arithmetic instructions in vmrun.c used the Norman's
    projection and embedding function
  - Jump and CondSkip in vmrun.c are inspired by Roger in the code review


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - Yes

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - literal pool 

Again supposing you are not selected to present, who in your group is
willing to serve on the review panel?

  - Both of us (Alex and Jasper)
