CS 106 Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Jasper Geer, Alex Bai

What work are you proud of?

  - Our use of the State monad to generate fresh labels

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - We have a problem in svm/lpool.c where using realloc() to resize our
    array of Values, which is queried when instructions request a literal
    at an index, causes a segmentation fault or bad realloc().
  - In CodeGen.hs, we have some trouble testing the getglobal operation,
    I'm not sure how getglobal will be generated from our kntest.scm`

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - lpool.c, the memory errors we are experiencing appear to be
    non-deterministic

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - None

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - No

We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - Yes, keeping state in a pure functional language might be an interesting
    topic.

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - Testing SVM primitives in K-Normal form
  - Correct implementation of codegen functions

Again supposing you are not selected to present, are you willing to
serve on the review panel? (Or if there are more than one of you, who
is willing to serve?)

  - Jasper, Alex
