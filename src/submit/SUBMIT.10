CS 106 Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Alex, Jasper

What work are you proud of?

  - Getting everything to work (we fixed bugs all the way from disambiguation
    to vmrun.c). Especially using the correct environment to generate code
    for the body of letrec (which has something to do with disambiguation that
    we wrote by ourself incorrectly (line 177 of Disambiguate.hs)).
    
    Getting more experience with debugging a functional language

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - closure helper function in closure-convert.hs, k normalization of letrec

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - letrec in k normalization

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - No

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - thanks for steph and vivian pointing out some cases for KnEmbed


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - We would very much like to present!

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - knormalization of letrec and the theory behind it

Again supposing you are not selected to present, are you willing to
serve on the review panel? (Or if there are more than one of you, who
is willing to serve?)

  - Alex and Jasper
