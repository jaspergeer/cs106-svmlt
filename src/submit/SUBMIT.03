CS 106 Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Alexander Bai, Jasper Geer

What work are you proud of?

  - understanding most of the UFT (how module interacts)

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - some parsings of common tokens are missing, which affects how to
    parse load_literal. Also want to cross check how it corresponds
    to the `get` functions in `tokens.h`.

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - line 185 of `asmparse.sml`, the loadliteral case of parsing
    one line instr

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  -  We are trying to work on a UFT in haskell, which will be based on
     Parsec, and code from UCSD CSE 230 (programming languages)
     https://github.com/ucsd-cse230-np/02-while

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - Norman pointed out why recursively calling vmrun with no limitation
    to access the original vm reprentation leads to catastrophic behaviors.
    We restore the register after dynamic load


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - No (we spent most of the time exploring how to write uft in haskell,
        our syntax design for virtual assembly code is problematic)

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - the unparse function. I will learn the most from other's perspective
    on the parsing mechanism of the uft

Again supposing you are not selected to present, who in your group is
willing to serve on the review panel?

  - Alex and Jasper
