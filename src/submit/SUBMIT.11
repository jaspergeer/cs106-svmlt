CS 106 Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Jasper, and Alex

What work are you proud of?

  - no valgrind errors, and getting everything right (as far as we know)

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - GC, scan_vmstate, VMLOAD, VMSAVE

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - gc

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - no

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - ClConvert.hs, we catch the setlocal case upstream


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - YES

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - gc, the analysis of scan_value/scan_forwarded_payload (and how
    to use them to justify scan_vmstate, and when popping grey object
    off the stack)

Again supposing you are not selected to present, are you willing to
serve on the review panel? (Or if there are more than one of you, who
is willing to serve?)

  - Alex, Jasper
