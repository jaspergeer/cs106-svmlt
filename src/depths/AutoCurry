## Demonstration for Dynamic Loading

Module 7

Curried functions [5 points]. You implement automatic currying as described in the handout on understanding procedure calls.

It can implement a partial-application semantics in which functions are automatically curried:

If there are extra actual parameters, the VM calls the function with only as many parameters as it is expecting, then applies the result to the extra parameters.

If there are missing actual parameters, the VM creates a closure that expects to receive the missing parameters, then activates the original function.

This is the semantics of Haskell and OCaml; it is available to implement for depth points.
