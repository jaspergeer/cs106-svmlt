Syntax of Virtual-Assembly Code

<instruction> ::= ObjectCode 
                | LoadFunc <arity> <body>
                | DefLabel <Label>
                | GotoLabel <Label>
                | IfGotolabel <reg>

<body>        ::= { <instruction> }

<literal>     ::= string | real | int | true | false | emptylist | nil

<arity> is an integer literal
<Label> is a string literal
<reg> is an integer literal in the range 0..255


Comments:

Important distinction in <literal> is that string do not take in length, and is not ascii characters
