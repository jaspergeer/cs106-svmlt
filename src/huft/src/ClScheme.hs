-- This file defines Closed Scheme,

-- Closed Scheme is just First-Order Scheme extended with CLOSURE, 
-- CAPTURED, and LETREC constructs. 
-- When you receive the file, 
-- it will have everything you need except a couple of cases of 
-- embedding of Closed Scheme into vScheme.
-- Youâ€™ll write these cases in step (@embedcases).
